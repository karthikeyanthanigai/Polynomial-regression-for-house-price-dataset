# Polynomial-regression-for-house-price-dataset
In this repository we will see what is this housing price prediction problem parameters/variable values and try to fit this values in a multiple linear regression.In this we will see both ols ***(Ordinary least squares)*** method and sgd
***(Stochastic Gradient Descent)*** method.
To run the code follow the below steps:

1.Install python(3.6+) and need packages.
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip instll pandas
```
```
pip install matplotlib
```
```
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
```
pip install seaborn
```

2.Clone this repository .
```
https://github.com/karthikeyanthanigai/Polynomial-regression-for-house-price-dataset.git
```
3.Open command line and set the directory to the cloned repository.
```
cd Polynomial-regression-for-house-price-dataset
```
4.Enter the command.
```
python poly.py
```

if you got any error in install the packages then refer [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).
The Prediction rate can be increased in other Regression models with Boosting and other methods/Algorithms.
